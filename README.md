# WeLcOmE tO mY gUeStBoOk!!

This is the starter app pt 6 for the Empireconf 2017 Glitch workshop. It was built in and runs on [glitch](https://glitch.com)!

In this workshop, attendees will learn about using glitch to take a static old-school guestbook page and take it full-stack so their guests can log in via twitter and leave fun nice messages!

In part six, we show our database entries of guestbook records instead of JSON!
* remove json records object
* create endpoint that sends our db records
* make an ajax call client-side that hits that new endpoint and adds our database records to the table
* P A R T Y ! ! !

### ← index.html

Where the content of the website lives

### ← styles.css

CSS files add styling rules to your content

### ← guestbook.js

the client side js in this file powers the guestbook front-end

### ← server.js

the server side code holds all the endpoints and database power
